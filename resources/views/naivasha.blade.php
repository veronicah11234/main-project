    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
        a freshwater lake in Kenya, outside the town of Naivasha in Nakuru County, which lies north west of Nairobi. It is part of the Great Rift Valley. 
        The name derives from the local Maasai name ɛnaɨpɔ́sha , meaning "that which heaves," a common Maasai word for bodies of water larger enough to have wave action when it is windy or stormy. 
        Naivasha arose as the British attempt to pronounce the Maasai name. Literally, Lake Naivasha means "Lake Lake."<br>

Lake Naivasha is at the highest elevation of the Kenyan Rift valley at 1,884 metres (6,181 ft) in a complex geological combination of volcanic rocks and sedimentary deposits from a larger Pleistocene Era lake. Apart from transient streams, the lake is fed by the perennial Malewa and Gilgil rivers. There is no visible outlet, but since the lake water is relatively fresh it is assumed to have an underground outflow.[2]

The lake had a normal surface area of 139 square kilometres (54 sq mi)[3] before 2010 and had increased to 198 square kilometres (76 sq mi) by 2020.
[4] It is surrounded by a swamp which covers an area of 64 square kilometres (25 sq mi), but this can vary largely depending on rainfall. It is situated at an altitude of 1,884 metres (6,181 ft).
[3] The lake has an average depth of 6 metres (20 ft), with the deepest area being at Crescent Island, at a maximum depth of 30 metres (98 ft).[3] Njorowa Gorge once formed the lake's outlet, but it is now high above the lake and forms the entrance to Hell's Gate National Park. 
The town of Naivasha (formerly East Nakuru) lies on the north-east edge of the lake.

    <p>
        Floriculture forms the main industry around the lake. However, the largely unregulated use of lake water for irrigation is reducing the level of the lake and is the subject of concern in Kenya. [7] Fishing in the lake is also another source of employment and income for the local population. 
        The lake varies in level greatly and almost dried up entirely in the 1890s. 
        Lake levels in general follow the rainfall pattern in the catchment area.<br>


        Lake Naivasha, once described as the Jewel in the Crown of all the East African lakes, has in recent decades been subjected to a series of devastating human pressures, not least the establishment of a vast horticulture and agriculture industry along its shorelines, but also the ever-increasing inflows of nutrients from siltation, sewage and other effluents emanating from a lakeside human population now approaching a million people.
        The water level for Lake Naivasha reached a low of 0.6 m depth in 1945, but the water level rose again, with minor drops, to reach a maximum depth of nearly 6 m in 1968.[3] There was another major decline of the water level in 1987, when the depth reached 2.25 m above the lake bottom.[3] The decline of the lake water level in 1987 increased concern in the future of geothermal industry, and it was speculated that Lake Naivasha underground water might be feeding the geothermal reservoir at Olkaria.
        [3] Hence, the decline in the lake water would affect the future of the geothermal industry.
