                        Masai Mara now also comprises a number of conservancies and group ranches bordering the main reserve and is home to some of the most diverse species of African wildlife and is also the site of the annual Wildebeest migration, 
                        simply known as the 'Great Migration'. Masai Mara National Park is famous for this migration, during which large herds of a million plus wildebeest, zebra and other wild animals including the Big Cats migrate north into the Mara from Serengeti National Park. The migration typically takes place between July to mid September and involves the wildebeest making dangerous crossings through crocodile-infested rivers.
                         The 'Mara', as Masai Mara is also known, is among the best wildlife reserves not just in Kenya but also in Africa and the aim of this website, Masai Mara .Travel, is to offer comprehensive information to guide visitors and tourists in planning their visit or for booking a Safari in Masai Mara, suited to their preference.

We aim to answer most if not all your questions through this platform.<br>

                    There are several exciting activities one can enjoy in Masai Mara.
